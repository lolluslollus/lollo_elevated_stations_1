				[h2]Modular elevated passenger station with no frills, available from 1960.[/h2]

This mod will add some "elevated" platforms, stations and tracks into the rail construction menu: use those for elevated stations and the normal ones for normal stations.

Some pics show other mods, like the excellent modular roof by oppiescc (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1991858933).

If you save a game, then uninstall this mod, you may break your game. To fix it, reinstall the mod and remove its artifacts.

Thanks to Enzojz for luadump.
